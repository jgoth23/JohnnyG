    <h1>About me</h1>
    
    <p> I would consider myself a highly motivated person. I like taking on new challenging activites.
     Often times if something scares me, I'm going to try it. Open mindedness and creativty are things that I try to incorporate on a daily basis.
     I pride myself on my curiousity for how things work and finding the answers to those questions.

   </div>
   <ul>
   <li>I'm currently working as a CNC machine operator. Ive been at the same company for over 10 years.</li>
     <li>The job has had its rewards over the years. Learning the job with no experience was something that held my interest at the beginnig but over the years has lost its appeal.</li> 
    <li>I've been grateful for the stability and opportunity it gave me.</li> 
    <li>Recently it's become clear that the ability to advance in a small company is non existant and I need to put my focus towards my future.</li>
