    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p> I'm currently working as a CNC machine operator. Ive had the position for the same company for over 10 years. 
     The job has had its rewards over the years. Learning the job with no experience was something that held my interest at the beginnig but over the years has lost its appeal. 
     I've been grateful for the stability and opportunity it gave me at the company but in recent years has shown that the ability to move up and advance is non existant. 
     I'm ready at this point to take on a new task and move on to a more rewarding future.</p>
